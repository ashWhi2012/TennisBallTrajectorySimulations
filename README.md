# TennisBallTrajectorySimulations
Used to create figures for Whitt's Wits article "How Hard Can You Hit a Tennis Ball?"
Code developed and improved by Claude Sonnet 4

BallFlight_Distance_from_Height.py was used for modeling Figure II

TestingTrajectories.py was used for Figure III

TennisBallFlight.py for Figure IV

You can copy and paste these files into your own .py files and run with any python interpreter. I used VScode for these plots.
Make sure you have downloaded the latest Python 3 version.
